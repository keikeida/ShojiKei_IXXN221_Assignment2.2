        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <img src="images/fgm.jpg" alt="fgm" width="500px" height="auto" class="fgm">
     <p align="right"  class="para1">Our Fairy Godmother began her studies at Hogwarts in her childhood. 
           During her time at Hogwarts, she became deeply interested in potion 
           studies and decided to begin her career. After her graduation from Hogwarts,
           Fairy Godmother takes an apprenticeship at Longslord's, the best potion makers in Too Far Away 
           and gains the greatest knowledge and skills from the best. With nothing more too learn from
           the best, she begins her journey around the world and arrived to Far Far Away around about the time
            the king was entitled his throne. Beginning from the small cottage at the end of Far Far Away, we have now
            grown our buisness to the greatest potion makers of Far Far Away.</p>

        <h2>What is Our Goal?</h2>
        <img src="images/happy.png" alt="prince charming" width="500px" height="auto" class="prince"> 
        <p align="left" class="para2">Every person in their childhood has some sort of memory that has been marked into our skin for all our lives. 
            We tend to dwell on things that stop us from our happiness. Our Fairy Godmother, noticed this during her time 
            spent traveling and researching around the world. So to help us reach our happiness, Fairy Godmother began making
            potions that takeway our insecurities so we can live with confidence and pride in ourselves to win our own Happily
            every after. Our goal is to make every single person in the world happy, and spread love and peace to the rest of the 
            world with our very own potions. Just one sip to your HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

        <h2>How we make Our Products</h2>
        <img src="images/ingredients.png"  alt="ingredients" width="450px" height="auto" class="ingredients" >
        <p align="right"  class="para3">All our products are cruelty free. Our main resources are fairy dusts that we stock in from faeries who stay in 
            our glass jar hotels who kindly volunteer to donate their fairy dusts. Our organic Mermaid scales and tears are imported 
            from Ursla (also a potion maker). Ursla is a company who has received top marks for her fairtrade and her environmentally
            friendly approaches made for her products. Our lovely swans we farm behind the cottage often accidently take out potions
            and show the results of out products that often turn out to be... fabulous of course. 
        </p>
